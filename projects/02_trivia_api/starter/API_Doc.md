# API Documentation

## Getting Started

- Base URL: Currently this app is ran locally, and not yet hosted on production environment as a Base URL. Therefore, the backend app is hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:5000/ which is the default address. And also set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

- API Keys or Authentication: This current version does not use authentication (API Keys) to access it.

## * Error Handling

Errors are turned as JSON objects (i.e key:Value pair) in the following structure:

```
    {
      'success': False,
      'error': 422,
      'message': 'unprocessable'
    }
```

The API will return five error types when requests failed:

- 404: Resource not found
- 405: Method not allowed
- 400: Bad request
- 422: Unprocessable
- 500: Internal server error
