# Udacity Trivia App

This project is a question and answering web app with the intended purpose of intellectual measurement among Udacity' Team. An individual is able to add a new question with its attributes such as; answer, rating, level of difficulty, and category that the question might falls under. Question could be searched by substring, any question that at such has the term in its content gets retrieved as a result of this operation. More also, new category could be added, at the list page, This views all questions without constraint of category. Although, the list is paginated to display ten (10) questions at a go to enhance efficiency of the system. Further more, answer can be viewed/hidden, level of difficulty is showed alongside with these questions. Similarly, the play page, list out all categories from which, player select the category he/she would love to test his/her intelligence or better still all could be chosen as well. User can supply his/her name to associate score with the name or might decide not to do so. For each round of play, a user has 5 trials or the app hunts by itself if no question is fetched i.e question is set to False.

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Developer Guidelines
Hi Developers, you might see this interested in. <em>TODO:<em> debug while onsubmission of answer the user score is not updated in the database.

## Getting started

#### This project is into two parts:

- Backend: hTis was implemented using Flask Python Framework
- and Frontend: This was implemented using react.js

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

Develpers using this project should always having Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines. All dependencies should be download inside virtual environment to help organise your dependencies across your projects.

#### Backend

Navigate into backend folder to run the following command:
` pip install -r requirement.txt
All required packages are included in the requirements file.

To run the application, run the following commands on terminal (Preferrably git bash for the purpose of windows OS' User). Still inside backend folder:
```
    export FLASK_APP=flaskr
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run --reload
```
Note: --reload is optional i.e can be omitted

The above commands, run the application in the development environment and direct our application to use the __init__.py file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made in our __init__.py file.
- Recommendation: If running on window, download git system to have access to its bash terminal inorder to be able to run the above listed commands or see [Flask Documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

The application is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration.

#### Frontend

Also, navigate into frontend folder to run the following command:
` npm install 
Once the dependencies are all installed, run the following command to start up our frontend.
` npm start

The application is running on http://127.0.0.1:3000/ by default.

### Tests

In order to run tests, navigate to the backend folder because there test_flaskr.py is contained. Therefore, run the commands when you are at backend folder directory.

` psql postgres postgres
- it will prompt you to enter your password as follows:
    - Password for user postgres:****(Note: this would be invisible, make sure you type it correctly).

You should have the following
```
psql (14.4)
WARNING: Console code page (437) differs from Windows code page (1252)
         8-bit characters might not work correctly. See psql reference
         page "Notes for Windows users" for details.
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
```
Run the following command sequentially inside the new interface opened by postgres:
`postgres=#DROP DATABASE trivia_test;
`postgres=#CREATE DATABASE trivia_test;
`postgres=#\i trivia.psql
`postgres=#\c trivia_test

You should then see:
`trivia_test=#

To quit the terminal
`trivia_test=#\q

Now, let run the test command, in the backend folder on terminal run this:
`python test_flaskr.py

The first time you run the tests, omit the `DROP DATABASE trivia_test;

All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality.<br>

# API Documentation

## Getting Started

- Base URL: Currently this app is ran locally, and not yet hosted on production environment as a Base URL. Therefore, the backend app is hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:5000/ which is the default address. And also set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

- API Keys or Authentication: This current version does not use authentication (API Keys) to access it.

## * Error Handling

Errors are turned as JSON objects (i.e key:Value pair) in the following structure:

```
    {
      'success': False,
      'error': 422,
      'message': 'unprocessable'
    }
```

The API will return five error types when requests failed:

- 404: Resource not found
- 405: Method not allowed
- 400: Bad request
- 422: Unprocessable
- 500: Internal server error

## Endpoints

### GET /categories

- General:
    - Returns a success, list of all the avialable category objects value, total number of categories
    
- Sample: curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/categories

```
    {
    "categories": [
        "Science",   
        "Art",

    "total_categories": 9
    }
```

### GET or POST /questions

- General:
This endpoint does listen to two different methods (GET and POST), therefore, responsible in handling three operations (retrieve, create, and search).

    - Returns a success, list of paginated (10 at a time) questions objects value, total number of questions, current category and list of all the avialable categories without pagination.

For POST method, this check for search term to decide which of operation to be performed between *create now question or *search questions based on a term supplied (*Note: substring in respective of the category).
    
    - If true, returns a success, list of questions found with the term part of its content, total questions in the database all together both the searched and unsearched ones, and also returns current category the first search belongs.

    - Else, creates a new question, and returns success on successful insertion.
    
- Sample: curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/questions

```

### POST /quizzes

This endpoint listens to POST method and returns success, quiz_category, previous questions in a list format, a randomized distinct question by taking track of the previous question(s) id(s) whither filtered by distinct category or query all categories, 

Sample: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"quiz_category": "Science", "previous_questions": []}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/quizzes

```
    {
        'success': True, 
        'quiz_category': 'Science',

            if randomIndex == size:
                return False
            s = selection[randomIndex]
            while s['id'] in previous_ids:
                randomIndex = random.randint(0, size)
